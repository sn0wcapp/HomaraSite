there are a couple things to fix here:  
1- the point history, search bar, and login + sign up buttons - as well as all of the menu buttons dont have any paths. 
there are some small styling inconsistencies / bugs - the "Homara Loves you" text and the pop up text for the expand / minimize menu buttons isnt styled the same.
